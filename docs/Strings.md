# Strings

Trifle supports strings. Strings are sequences of unicode code
points.

String literals consist of characters between double quotes,
e.g. `"blacmange"` and `"flamb√©"`. Backslashes are not permitted
between double quotes. Unlike many other programming languages,
newlines may occur between double quotes.
