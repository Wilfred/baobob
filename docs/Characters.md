# Characters

Trifle supports characters. A character represents a single unicode
code point. Characters are immutable.

Character literals consist of single quotes around a single
character, e.g. `'a'` and `' '`. Backslashes and single quotes are not
permitted between single quotes. Any other character may occur, including
newlines.
