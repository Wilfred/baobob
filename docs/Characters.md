# Characters

Trifle supports characters. A character represents a single unicode
code point. Characters are immutable.

Character literals consist of single quotes around a single
character, e.g. `'a'` and `' '`. Any character may occur between
single quotes (including newlines), except backslashes and single quotes. The following
escaped characters are recognised: `'\\'`, `'\''`, `'\n'`.
