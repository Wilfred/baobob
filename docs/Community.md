# Community

The Trifle community currently uses the bug tracker for most
discussion. However, there's also a `#trifle` IRC channel on Freenode.

Please note that both the bug tracker and offical IRC channel are
subject to the
[Trifle code of conduct](https://github.com/Wilfred/trifle/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).
