# Special Expressions

Special expressions are expressions that are evaluated at run time,
like functions. Unlike functions, special expressions choose when (and
if) they evaluate their argumets.

Special functions are built-in to the Trifle interpreter. Trifle does
not support user-defined special functions (sometimes called
f-expressions).
