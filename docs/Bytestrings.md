# Bytestrings

Trifle supports bytestrings. Bytestrings are sequences of 8-bit
integers without any specific meaning: they may binary data such as
images, encoded text, or any other piece of data. Bytestrings are
mutable.

Bytestring literals consist of printable ASCII characters between double
quotes, e.g. `#bytes("foo")`.
