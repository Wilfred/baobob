# Getting Started

To use Trifle lisp, you will need to compile it yourself. See
[building](Building.md) for more details.

Once compiled, you may wish to use the interpreter interactively (see
[interpreter](Interpreter.md)). If you're looking to write Trifle code
in Emacs, there's a
[major mode available](https://github.com/Wilfred/.emacs.d/blob/gh-pages/user-lisp/trifle-mode.el).

If you get stuck, don't hesitate to
[file a bug](https://github.com/wilfred/trifle/issues) or
[reach out to the community](Community.md).
