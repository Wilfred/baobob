# Baobab Lisp

Baobab lisp is an experimental lisp dialect. All code is LGPLv3, all
documentation is CC-BY.

The name baobab is chosen to describe a language that develops over
time, based on its environment (in this respect, programming is often
closer to gardening than engineering).

## Status

There are a few ideas written out, no code yet.
