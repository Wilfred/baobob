# Baobab Lisp

Baobab lisp is an experimental lisp dialect. All code is LGPLv3, all
documentation is CC-BY.

The name baobab is chosen to describe a language that develops over
time, based on its environment (in this respect, programming is often
closer to gardening than engineering).

Baobab is inspired by Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure. It will include
a npm style package manager, and everything, even the standard
library, will just be a package. The languages aims to be maximally
hackable, focusing the full gamut of macros (unhygenic and macros) and
excellent interactive development (SLIME style with pervasive docstrings).

A new programming language should really have a good answer to 'how do
I run it in the browser?', 'how do I scale it to multiple cores?' and
'how do I interface with C code?'. Since this is an experimental
language, we are cheerfully ignoring these questions for now.

## Status

There are a few ideas written out, no code yet.
